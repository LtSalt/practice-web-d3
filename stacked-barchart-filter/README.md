## README

More practice on stacked barcharts, among other things.
- Added a radio input: user can toggle filter
- Transitions and object constancy with enter / update selections
- More arquero practice (though I'm not sure if I like it)
- Using `|| 0` as afallback for undefined or missing values

# TODO
- Put global variables in closure
- Object constancy and scales: had to reverse one color scale, otherwise the colors would switch when the data was updated - reason unclear
- Used a border styling on the upstream `g` element - margins are obsolete here, could be removed
